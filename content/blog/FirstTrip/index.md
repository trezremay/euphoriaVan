This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

So this is getting used to blogging, neither Jess or I have ever blogged before but here we go!

Welcome to our travel blog! So we are converting a Volkeswagen Transporter T5 Caravelle, we just bought it a few weeks ago so at the moment is basically a van with a couple little bits done, like taking the seats out and making it a bit cozier. Doing this first trip proved that we were very far away from where we wanted to be but was the perfect opportunity for us to get an idea what we wanted to do with it, what we needed, the types of places we wanted to go and what to expect in the future!



Oh, and here's a great quote from Lao Tzu which sums up our experience

> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step


## How trip one went 
We had a phenonomenal first trip, it was everything we wanted it to be and everything we thought it would be about, it didn't take us long to realise the van life was for us.

Being new to driving a now massive van compared to the now seemingly tiny alfa romeo we had used before, I was a bit nervous to take it long haul somewhere afar, but I knew I wanted to go somewhere, however, we are fortunate enough to live in the Cotswolds so finding somewhere nice wasn't difficult. So we settled on somewhere local by the River Severn, the Red Lion pub in Wainlode, we both had the Friday and Saturday off from working, so we took the bench seats out of the van, packed an airbed, quilt and fairy lights and headed off on our first adventure, after stopping off at the local shop for some food and snack, of course!

So after picking up some essentials, crisps, beer and gin to mention a few, we were on our way! Excitedly in the van we pulled up into a quiet area overlooking the river, just coming to the end of the summer, so it was still warm but was lovely and quiet after the rush of the holidays, it was perfect!

We swiftly turned the van from a jam packed car to our home for the night, all in all it took about 30 minutes and we were all set up with fairy lights in tow, we cooked some food on our camping stove and cozied in for the night, we didn't have any curtains or anything so we just tied a load of blankets up to box us in and keep out the light which only added to the coziness of our night.

We woke up bright and early the next day went for a stroll, and had a coffee we really enjoyed our night but knew we needed to plan out what to do and how we're going to do it.

So we want to build a more homely van which we can live as digital nomads for extended periods of time which we are really excited for, so we will be posting regular updates, thanks for reading and hope we see you again!
